- database architecture:

  - sessions: each time “track” a task, a session is logged
  - milestones: used for incentives, streaks, or mastery checkpoints
  - reviews: weekly or periodic reflections to prevent dropouts
  - config: stores TOML-loaded goals or user preferences
  - coach_messages: prewritten or dynamic messages triggered by milestones or streaks => id, trigger_type, content, sent_at
  - calendar: for `cal` command—important dates, breaks, or annotations => id, date, note
  - tags: to categorize tasks (e.g., "creative", "fitness", "learning") => id, name

- use error handling => `horus`
- resolve embedding! => `sisu` can only be used now from developer path
